Since we can see that are many outlier items being sold, we would want to eliminate those outliers from skewing our data. 
At first glace, using the median instead of the average seems like the best way of eliminating this, but when we take a closer look, 
we can see that the only shoes selling for more than $400 all come from shop_id 42. Because of this, we will just eliminate all orders from shop_id 42. 

For my final metric, I would remove all items from shop_id 42, then divide each order total by the amount of items to get the average item value. My final answer for the average
item value is $150.40
