/*Since we can see that are many outlier items being sold, we would want to eliminate those outliers from skewing our data. 
At first glace, using the median instead of the average seems like the best way of eliminating this, but when we take a closer look, 
we can see that the only shoes selling for more than $400 all come from shop_id 78. Because of this, we will just eliminate all orders from shop_id 78. 

To do this, I would use the query as follows /*

SELECT *
FROM INTERNCHAL
WHERE shop_id != 78
AVG(order_amount)
